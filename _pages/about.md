<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently a <span style="color: #960018;">Postdoctoral Fellow</span> at <span style="color: #960018;">Harvard University</span>, where I began my appointment in October 2024. Under the mentorship of Professor Flavio P. Calmon, my research focuses on Trust in Generative AI.

From December 2022 to August 2024, I was a <span style="color: #960018;">Postdoctoral Researcher</span> in the Biometric Security & Privacy group at the <span style="color: #960018;">Idiap Research Institute</span>, working under the supervision of Professor Sébastien Marcel. I received my <span style="color: #960018;">Ph.D. in Computer Science</span> from the <span style="color: #960018;">University of Geneva</span> in 2022, where I was advised by Professor Slava Voloshynovskiy in the Stochastic Information Processing (SIP) group. During my Ph.D., I spent six months as a Visiting Research Fellow at <span style="color: #960018;">Harvard University</span>, collaborating with Professor Flavio P. Calmon, and another six months as a Visiting Research Scholar at <span style="color: #960018;">Imperial College London</span>, working with Professor Deniz Gündüz.

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an <span style="color: #960018;">M.Sc. in Mathematics (Numerical Analysis)</span> from Iran University of Science and Technology in 2017, and an <span style="color: #960018;">M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Communications Systems)</span> from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2014, advised by Professor Touraj Nikazad and Professor Ghosheh Abed Hodtani, respectively.

My research interests encompass the application of mathematical, statistical, and information theories to <span style="color: #960018;">machine learning</span>, <span style="color: #960018;">data privacy</span>, and <span style="color: #960018;">signal processing</span>, with a particular emphasis on development of <span style="color: #960018;">trustworthy AI technologies</span> in <span style="color: #960018;">biometric systems</span> and <span style="color: #960018;">healthcare problems</span>.
