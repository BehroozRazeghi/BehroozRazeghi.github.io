I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Biometric Security & Privacy group at the Idiap Research Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Geneva in 2022, where Professor Slava Voloshynovskiy advised me in the Stochastic Information Processing (SIP) group. During my time at the University of Geneva, I also spent six months as a Visiting Research Fellow at Harvard University, collaborating with Professor Flavio P. Calmon, and another six months as a Visiting Research Scholar at Imperial College London, working with Professor Deniz Gündüz. Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Communications) from the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2014, and an M.Sc. in Mathematics (Numerical Analysis) from Iran University of Science and Technology in 2017, where I was advised by Professor Ghosheh Abed Hodtani and Professor Touraj Nikazad, respectively.

My research interests include the applications of mathematical and statistical theories to signal processing, machine learning, data privacy, communications, and networking problems.
