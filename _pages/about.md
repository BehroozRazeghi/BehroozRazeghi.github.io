<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a <span style="color: red;">Postdoctoral Researcher</span> in the <span style="color: red;">Biometric Security & Privacy</span> group at the <span style="color: red;">Idiap Research Institute</span>, working under the supervision of <span style="color: red;">Professor Sébastien Marcel</span>. I received my <span style="color: red;">Ph.D. in Computer Science</span> from the <span style="color: red;">University of Geneva</span> in 2022, where I was advised by <span style="color: red;">Professor Slava Voloshynovskiy</span> in the <span style="color: red;">Stochastic Information Processing (SIP)</span> group. During my Ph.D., I spent six months as a <span style="color: red;">Visiting Research Fellow</span> at <span style="color: red;">Harvard University</span>, collaborating with <span style="color: red;">Professor Flavio P. Calmon</span>, and another six months as a <span style="color: red;">Visiting Research Scholar</span> at <span style="color: red;">Imperial College London</span>, working with <span style="color: red;">Professor Deniz Gündüz</span>.

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an <span style="color: red;">M.Sc. in Mathematics (Numerical Analysis)</span> from <span style="color: red;">Iran University of Science and Technology</span> in 2017, and an <span style="color: red;">M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Communications Systems)</span> from <span style="color: red;">Ferdowsi University of Mashhad</span> in 2014, advised by <span style="color: red;">Professor Touraj Nikazad</span> and <span style="color: red;">Professor Ghosheh Abed Hodtani</span>, respectively.

My research interests encompass the application of <span style="color: red;">mathematical, statistical, and information theories</span> to <span style="color: red;">machine learning</span>, <span style="color: red;">data privacy</span>, and <span style="color: red;">signal processing</span>, with a particular emphasis on development of <span style="color: red;">trustworthy AI technologies</span> in <span style="color: red;">biometric systems</span> and <span style="color: red;">healthcare problems</span>.
